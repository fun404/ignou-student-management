					<dd>
						<p>Software cost comprises a small percentage of overall computer-based system cost. 
							There are a number of factors, which are considered, that can affect the ultimate cost of 
						the software such as - human, technical, Hardware and Software availability etc. </p>
						<p>The main point that was considered during the cost estimation of project was its sizing. 
							In spite of complete software sizing, function point and approximate lines of code were 
							also used to "size" each element of the Software and their costing.
